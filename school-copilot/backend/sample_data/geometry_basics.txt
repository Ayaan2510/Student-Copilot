Chapter 1: Introduction to Geometry

Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, positions, angles, and dimensions of objects. It is one of the oldest mathematical sciences.

Basic geometric elements include:
- Points: A location in space with no dimension
- Lines: Extend infinitely in both directions
- Planes: Flat surfaces that extend infinitely in all directions
- Angles: Formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint

Chapter 2: Triangles

A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles. The sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Types of triangles by sides:
- Equilateral: All three sides are equal
- Isosceles: Two sides are equal
- Scalene: All three sides are different

Types of triangles by angles:
- Acute: All angles are less than 90 degrees
- Right: One angle is exactly 90 degrees
- Obtuse: One angle is greater than 90 degrees

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.

Chapter 3: Quadrilaterals

A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides and four angles. The sum of all angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

Types of quadrilaterals:
- Square: All sides equal, all angles 90 degrees
- Rectangle: Opposite sides equal, all angles 90 degrees
- Rhombus: All sides equal, opposite angles equal
- Parallelogram: Opposite sides parallel and equal
- Trapezoid: One pair of parallel sides

Chapter 4: Circles

A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point called the center.

Important circle terms:
- Radius: Distance from center to any point on the circle
- Diameter: Distance across the circle through the center (2 × radius)
- Circumference: Distance around the circle (2πr or πd)
- Area: Space inside the circle (πr²)

Chapter 5: Area and Perimeter

Area is the amount of space inside a shape, measured in square units.
Perimeter is the distance around the outside of a shape.

Common area formulas:
- Rectangle: length × width
- Triangle: ½ × base × height
- Circle: π × radius²
- Parallelogram: base × height

Common perimeter formulas:
- Rectangle: 2(length + width)
- Triangle: sum of all three sides
- Circle: 2π × radius

Chapter 6: Volume and Surface Area

Volume is the amount of space inside a three-dimensional object, measured in cubic units.
Surface area is the total area of all surfaces of a three-dimensional object.

Common volume formulas:
- Cube: side³
- Rectangular prism: length × width × height
- Cylinder: π × radius² × height
- Sphere: (4/3) × π × radius³

These concepts are fundamental for understanding three-dimensional geometry and real-world applications.

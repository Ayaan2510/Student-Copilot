Chapter 1: Introduction to Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. The basic operations in algebra include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Variables are symbols (usually letters) that represent unknown values. For example, in the equation x + 5 = 10, the variable x represents the unknown value 5.

The fundamental principle of algebra is that whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side to maintain equality.

Chapter 2: Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation that makes a straight line when graphed. The general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

To solve a linear equation, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. For example, to solve 2x + 6 = 14, we subtract 6 from both sides to get 2x = 8, then divide both sides by 2 to get x = 4.

Linear equations can be used to model real-world situations such as calculating costs, determining rates, and predicting outcomes.

Chapter 3: Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2. The general form is ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0.

The quadratic formula can be used to solve any quadratic equation:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

Quadratic equations often have two solutions, which can be real or complex numbers. The discriminant (b² - 4ac) determines the nature of the solutions.

Chapter 4: Systems of Equations

A system of equations is a set of two or more equations with the same variables. There are several methods to solve systems of equations:

1. Substitution method: Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other equation.
2. Elimination method: Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable.
3. Graphing method: Graph both equations and find their intersection point.

Systems of equations are useful for solving problems involving multiple constraints or conditions.

Chapter 5: Polynomials

A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, involving operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.

Examples of polynomials:
- Linear: 3x + 2
- Quadratic: x² - 5x + 6
- Cubic: 2x³ + x² - 4x + 1

Polynomial operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Factoring polynomials is an important skill for solving polynomial equations.

Chapter 6: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Exponential functions have the form f(x) = a^x, where a is a positive constant called the base. These functions model growth and decay processes.

Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions. The logarithm base b of a number x is the exponent to which b must be raised to get x.

Properties of logarithms:
- log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)
- log_b(x/y) = log_b(x) - log_b(y)
- log_b(x^n) = n × log_b(x)

These functions are essential in many fields including science, engineering, and finance.
